:toc: left
:source-highlighter: rouge

* The pacman package manager is one of the major distinguishing features of
  Arch Linux.
* It combines a simple binary package format with an easy-to-use Arch build
  system.
* The goal of _pacman_ is to make it possible to easily manage packages, whether
  they are from the official repositories or the user's own builds.

'''

* _Pacman_ keeps the system up-to-date by synchronizing package lists with the
  master server.
* This server/client model also allows the user to download/install packages
  with a simple command, complete with all required dependencies.

'''

* _Pacman_ is written in the C programming language and uses the `bsdtar(1)`
  tar format for packaging.

== 1 Usage

* What follows is just a small sample of the operations that _pacman_ can
  perform.
* To read more examples, refer to `pacman(8)`.

=== 1.1 Installing packages

* A package is an archive containing:
** all of the (compiled) files of an application
** metadata about the application, such as application name, version,
   dependencies, etc.
** installation files and directives for _pacman_

* Arch's package manager _pacman_ can install, update, and remove those
  packages.
* Using packages instead of compiling and installing programs yourself has
  various benefits:
easily updatable::
_pacman_ will update existing packages as soon as updates are available
dependency checks::
_pacman_ handles dependencies for you, you only need to specify the program and
pacman installs it together with every other program it needs
clean removal::
_pacman_ has a list of every file in a package; this way, no files are
unintentionally left behind when you decide to remove a package.

[WARNING]
====
* When installing packages in Arch, avoid refreshing the package list without
  upgrading the system (for example, when a package is no longer found in the
  official repositories).
* In practice, do not run `pacman -Sy _package_name_` instead of `pacman -Syu
  _package_name_`, as this could lead to dependency issues.

=== 1.1.1 Installing specific packages

* To install a single package or list of packages, including dependencies,
  issue the following command:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
# pacman -S _package_name1_ _package_name2_ ...

* To install a list of packages with regex:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
# pacman -S $(pacman -Ssq _package_regex_)

* Sometimes there are multiple versions of a package in different repositories
  (e.g. _extra_ and _testing_).
* To install the version from the extra repository in this example, the
  repository needs to be defined in front of the package name:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
# pacman -S extra/_package_name_

* To install a number of packages sharing similar patterns in their names, one
  can use curly brace expansion.
* For example:
+
[source,sh]
# pacman -S plasma-{desktop,mediacenter,nm}

* This can be expanded to however many levels needed:
+
[source,sh]
# pacman -S plasma-{workspace{,-wallpapers},pa}

=== 1.1.2 Installing package groups

* Some packages belong to a group of packages that can all be installed
  simultaneously.
* For example, issuing the command:
+
[source,sh]
# pacman -S gnome
+
will prompt you to select the packages from the gnome group that you wish to
install.

'''

* Sometimes a package group will contain a large amount of packages, and there
  may be only a few that you do or do not want to install.
* Instead of having to enter all the numbers except the ones you do not want,
  it is sometimes more convenient to select or exclude packages or ranges of
  packages with the following syntax:
+
....
Enter a selection (default=all): 1-10 15
....
+
which will select packages 1 through 10 and 15 for installation, or:
+
....
Enter a selection (default=all): ^5-8 ^2
....
+
which will select all packages except 5 through 8 and 2 for installation.

'''

* To see what packages belong to the gnome group, run:
+
[source,sh]
$ pacman -Sg gnome

* Also visit https://archlinux.org/groups/ to see what package groups are
  available.

[NOTE]
====
* If a package in the list is already installed on the system, it will be
  reinstalled even if it is already up-to-date.
* This behavior can be overridden with the `--needed` option.
====

=== 1.2 Removing packages

* To remove a single package, leaving all of its dependencies installed:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
# pacman -R _package_name_

* To remove a package and its dependencies which are not required by any other
  installed package:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
# pacman -Rs _package_name_

[WARNING]
====
* When removing a group, such as gnome, this ignores the install reason of the
  packages in the group, because it acts as though each package in the group is
  listed separately.
* Install reason of dependencies is still respected.
====

* Pacman saves important configuration files when removing certain applications
  and names them with the extension: `.pacsave`.
* To prevent the creation of these backup files use the `-n` option:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
# pacman -Rn _package_name_

[NOTE]
====
* Pacman will not remove configurations that the application itself creates
  (for example "dotfiles" in the home directory).
====

=== 1.3 Upgrading packages

[WARNING]
====
* Users are expected to follow the guidance in the System maintenance#Upgrading
  the system section to upgrade their systems regularly and not blindly run the
  following command.
* Arch only supports full system upgrades.
* See System maintenance#Partial upgrades are unsupported and #Installing
  packages for details.
====

* _Pacman_ can update all packages on the system with just one command.
* This could take quite a while depending on how up-to-date the system is.
* The following command synchronizes the repository databases and updates the
  system's packages, excluding "local" packages that are not in the configured
  repositories:
+
[source,sh]
# pacman -Syu

=== 1.4 Querying package databases

* _Pacman_ queries the local package database with the `-Q` flag, the sync
  database with the `-S` flag and the files database with the `-F` flag.
* See `pacman -Q --help`, `pacman -S --help` and `pacman -F --help` for the
  respective suboptions of each flag.

'''

* _Pacman_ can search for packages in the database, searching both in packages'
  names and descriptions:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
$ pacman -Ss _string1_ _string2_ ...

* Sometimes, `-s`'s builtin ERE (Extended Regular Expressions) can cause a lot
  of unwanted results, so it has to be limited to match the package name only;
  not the description nor any other field:
+
[source,sh]
$ pacman -Ss '^vim-'

* To search for already installed packages:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
$ pacman -Qs _string1_ _string2_ ...

* To search for package file names in remote packages:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
$ pacman -F _string1_ _string2_ ...

* To display extensive information about a given package (e.g. its
  dependencies):
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
$ pacman -Si _package_name_

* For locally installed packages:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
$ pacman -Qi _package_name_

* Passing two `-i` flags will also display the list of backup files and their
  modification states:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
$ pacman -Qii _package_name_

* To retrieve a list of the files installed by a package:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
$ pacman -Ql _package_name_

* To retrieve a list of the files installed by a remote package:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
$ pacman -Fl _package_name_

* To verify the presence of the files installed by a package:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
$ pacman -Qk _package_name_

* Passing the `k` flag twice will perform a more thorough check.

'''

* To query the database to know which package a file in the file system belongs
  to:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
$ pacman -Qo _/path/to/file_name_

* To query the database to know which remote package a file belongs to:
+
[source,sh,subs=quotes]
$ pacman -F _/path/to/file_name_

* To list all packages no longer required as dependencies (orphans):
+
[source,sh]
$ pacman -Qdt

* To list all packages explicitly installed and not required as dependencies:
+
[source,sh]
$ pacman -Qet

* See pacman/Tips and tricks for more examples.

==== 1.4.1 Pactree

[NOTE]
====
* `pactree(8)` is not part of the `pacman` package anymore.
* Instead it can be found in `pacman-contrib`.
====

* To view the dependency tree of a package:
+
[source,sh]
$ pactree package_name

* To view the dependant tree of a package, pass the reverse flag `-r` to _pactree_

== 2 Configuration

* _Pacman_ settings are located in `/etc/pacman.conf`: this is the place where
  the user configures the program to work in the desired manner.
* In-depth information about the configuration file can be found in
  `pacman.conf(5)`.

=== 2.1 General options

* General options are in the `[options]` section.
* Read `pacman.conf(5)` or look in the default `pacman.conf` for information on
  what can be done here.

==== 2.1.6 Skip files from being installed to system

* To always skip installation of specific files or directories list them under
  `NoExtract`.
* Later rules override previous ones, and you can negate a rule by prepending `!`.
