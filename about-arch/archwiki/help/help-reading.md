## 5 Source

- Some applications, notably command-line shells, use scripts for their configuration: after modifying them, they must be sourced in order for the changes to be applied.

- In the case of bash, for example, this is done by running (you can also replace `source` with `.`):

```shell
$ source ~/.bashrc
```
